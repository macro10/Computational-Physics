# Computational-Physics
This repository contains all of the projects I worked on during the spring semester of 2022 at High Point University in Computational Physics. PHY 2200 is a project-based introduction to computational physics through computational modeling that is taught by Dr. Titus. Throughout the class I learned to construct, solve, validate, and communicate mathematical models of physical systems. In my projects, I explored topics such as particle distribution, modelling motion with ODE integration, radial oscillations, curve fitting, and modelling standing wave oscillations.
